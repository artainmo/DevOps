## Udemy course - AWS certified cloud practitioner
Other cloud providers than amazon exist. Here, we will specifically learn how to use AWS. However, this knowledge can also be applied to other cloud platforms.

In this course 40 amazon web services (AWS) out of 200+ will be covered. The 'cloud practitioner' certificate is foundational. It can be followed by other certificates, usually the 'solutions architect' which contains more practice, and lastly a specialty certificate such as the 'machine learning' or 'security' AWS certificate.

To use amazon's cloud products we first need to create an AWS account to then access the AWS platform.

### What is cloud computing?
A server is necessary to host a website, contains central processing units (CPU) to compute and random-access memory (RAM) for memory that can be stored and retrieved quickly. A server can also have a database for long-term data storage and routers, switch, DNS server for networking.

In the past own website would run on own server(s). This comes with downsides such as costs related to buying servers, space, power supply, maintenance, infrastructure monitoring, scaling or replacing hardware takes more time and is more complicated.<br>
The cloud resolves those problems by allowing rental of external servers and thus delegation of associated tasks.

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.<br>
Via a web-applications you can indicate how much cloud computing resources you need. Usually with cloud platforms you only pay for what you use which we call pay-as-you-go pricing. 

Netflix and dropbox are examples of services who are built on AWS.

Private cloud are cloud services used by a single organization. While public cloud is delivered to the public via internet. AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google cloud are public clouds. Hybrid clouds keep certain servers for own private company while others others are available to others. Amazon for example has own servers and sells the use of other servers as his AWS product.
